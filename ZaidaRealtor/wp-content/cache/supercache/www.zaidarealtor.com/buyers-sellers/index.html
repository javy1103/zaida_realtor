	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>10 Steps Before Buying a Home</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Step 1, Get Your Finances in Order</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your credit reports are an ongoing look at how you manage your finances. You must know exactly what your credit reports say about your financial history <i>before you apply</i> for a mortgage, because the reports play an important role in the mortgage approval process and in determining the interest rate and other loan terms that a lender offers you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Step 2, Get Familiar with the Mortgage Industry</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding the right loan and lender is crucial to your home buying success. It&#8217;s up to you to determine which lender is best for your needs, and it&#8217;s always a good idea to have at least a bit of background about the loan process before you talk to a lender.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Step 3, Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Do you know how much house you can afford? Probably not, unless you&#8217;ve talked with a lender.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pre-approval helps you in other ways. Consider this scenario. A home seller gets two similar offers. One is accompanied by a letter from the buyer&#8217;s bank that states she is pre-approved for a mortgage in the amount of the offer. The other has no supporting documents. Which offer do you think the seller will consider first?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Step 4, Determine Your Wants and Needs</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Buying a home isn&#8217;t as difficult as you might think, even if you&#8217;re short on funds, but the process will go a lot smoother if you get familiar with your real estate market and narrow down your wants and needs before you start looking at houses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Step 5, Learn to Work with Real Estate Agents</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Real estate agents represent buyers, sellers, or both&#8211;and in some states they can work as neutral facilitators for either party. It&#8217;s essential to understand agent duties and loyalties before you make that first phone call.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Checklist before buying a house</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. Search for neighborhood information online.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you already live in the community, you may be able to skip this step, but it’s always worthwhile to search local newspaper websites, local government sites, community sites and blogs to find out what’s happening in terms of upcoming development or other issues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2. Check the crime report.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your local police station will have statistics on crime and you can also go to <a href="http://www.crimereports.com/"><span class="s2">www.crimereports.com</span></a> to find information according to a particular address or ZIP code.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3. Check on the schools.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even if you don’t have children, buying a home in a good school district is an important way to make sure your home maintains its value. You can find information on each school district website or go to <a href="http://www.greatschools.com/"><span class="s2">www.GreatSchools.com</span></a> for ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>4. Check for local amenities</b></span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can go to Google Maps for a Street View of a community to see what’s nearby, or visit <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/"><span class="s2">www.WalkScore.com</span></a> to find out what is within walking distance of the home. If you have a particular activity that you enjoy, such as tennis or golf or swimming, find out how far you’ll have to go to get to a facility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>5. Check for neighborhood amenities.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re buying within a homeowners association, you can usually find information online about community activities, but even in areas without an association some neighborhoods have frequent community-wide gatherings or sports leagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6. Visit the home at different times of day.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you want to know what it will be like to live somewhere, visit on a weekday, a weeknight and a weekend to see how quiet or active the area will be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>7. Test your commute.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you only visit a home on a weekend you’ll have no idea what the traffic pattern is like during rush hour, which could have a big impact on your enjoyment of the property.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>8. Schedule a home inspection</b></span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your purchase offer should include a home inspection so you know what repairs must be made and about how they will cost. You may or may not be able to negotiate for the seller to pay for home improvements, but it’s always better to go into a house with full knowledge of its condition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>9. Talk to the sellers</b></span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the sellers are willing to share information with you, they’re the best resource of all to learn about the community and the house. You can ask the sellers about renovations they’ve done and even talk to them about whether your plans for the house are possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>10. Ask about taxes, homeowner association dues, homeowners insurance and utility bills.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your monthly housing payment includes more than just the principal and interest on your loan. Make sure the taxes, insurance, homeowner association dues and utility bills will fit into your budget.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before Talking to a Mortgage Lender you should get a copy of your credit report and examine it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Current Pay Stubs.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your last two pay stubs. Make copies and don&#8217;t hand out your originals.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is your wage and tax statement, issued by your employer for a calendar year. It is what you attach to your tax returns. Lenders generally want the last two year&#8217;s of W2s from both of you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Federal Tax Returns.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you haven&#8217;t yet filed your tax return for last year, then find the two previous year&#8217;s of tax returns. Make copies. Include all schedules. Tip: Make sure the tax returns are signed by you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Bank Statements.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some lenders want two months, while others will demand the last three months of bank statements. Make a copy from each lending institution. Include every page of each bank statement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Asset Statements.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you own stocks, bonds, mutual funds or retirement accounts, make a copy of each statement. Lenders prefer hard copies over those printed online but will accept online statements if that&#8217;s how you receive your statements. Make copies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Copy of Current Driver&#8217;s License.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are meeting with the lender in person, you can bring your driver&#8217;s license with you for identification and reproduction. Otherwise, copy your license on a scanner or copy machine and include it. Your license should have a photograph of you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Ask About Upfront Costs.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Many lenders will request a credit report fee, but some do not. Generally, <a href="http://homebuying.about.com/od/glossarya/g/Appraisal.htm"><span class="s2">appraisal</span></a></span> <span class="s1">and credit report fees are paid in advance when you are ready to accept the loan.

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Financing Process</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If any step in buying a home is confusing, complex, or tedious, it&#8217;s figuring out how to get the right kind of financing. However, since the Internet has made it relatively easy to learn about, shop for, and secure great mortgages, the frustration factor of getting financing has been mercifully reduced.</span></p>
<p>The first step is to learn how home financing works. In a nutshell, the process involves the following steps:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Checking Your Credit History</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your credit report has mistakes or other blemishes, your credit rating will suffer, and as a result, you will pay higher interest rates and may even be unable to secure financing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first step is to get a copy of your credit report. There are 3 major credit bureaus, but since they don&#8217;t share information, it pays to make sure that each report is error-free. Each report will cost around $8, and a merged report from all 3 is around $30. You can get a merged 3-agency credit report online from</span><span class="s2">ConsumerInfo.com</span><span class="s1"> or you can call the credit bureaus directly:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equifax: 1.800.997.2493<br />
Trans-Union: 1.800.888.4213<br />
Experian: 1.888.397.3742</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To fix errors on your credit report or if you would like to improve any negative records, try the </span><span class="s2">Consumer Credit Counseling</span><span class="s1"> site, which gives advice on how you can either remedy errors or start to establish a better track record with creditors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Getting Prequalified</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When preparing to buy a home, you have to estimate how much home you can afford. Similarly before you apply for financing, you should allow a lender to size up how much mortgage you can afford. Using financial information that you provide, prequalification is a lender&#8217;s analysis of your general position as a borrower or, in other words, an estimate of what you can afford.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides giving you an even better idea of what you can afford, getting prequalified helps you make an informed application for your mortgage preapproval and is evidence to realtors that you will be able to get financing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Shopping for Loans</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The terms of your mortgage will probably be the biggest determinant of the size of your monthly payment, so you&#8217;ll want to shop around. The main points to resolve are figuring out what kind of loan you want, who you want to provide it, and for how long you want it (most are either for 15 or 30 years).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if you don&#8217;t feel comfortable taking out a loan online, it still pays to shop for loans online in order to learn more about the kinds of available loans, what rates are competitive, and to calculate the financial consequences of each loan so that you can more effectively negotiate mortgage terms with a local lender.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When shopping for loans, remember that the interest rate isn&#8217;t the only cost involved with a loan. The size of the down payment as well as &#8220;points&#8221; (or prepaid interest) and other fees can significantly alter the cost, especially the upfront cost.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Getting Preapproved</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting preapproved is a firm commitment from a lender to loan you up to a maximum amount without a specific property being identified.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Preapproval is a useful step because you go through the financing process before making an offer on a home, so the time required for the process itself won&#8217;t jeopardize your offer. And once you are preapproved, closing the loan is quick, depending only on a satisfactory appraisal and title report of the home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get preapproved, you apply for a loan program, submit an application, and provide financial information. </span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>How Do You Choose a REALTOR?</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Local Realtors are the community experts. They track real estate trends, share neighborhood concerns and participate in local matters. They’re good neighbors who are in the business of helping others buy and sell homes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buyers and sellers have different needs. In some cases, sellers elect to meet with one Realtor, while a buyer might elect to test a couple of agents before deciding to work with one exclusively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whatever your preference, there will be a number of questions you will want to ask:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What services do you offer?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What type of representation do you provide?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some agents<a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/buyer-agents-work-free/"> represent buyers</a>, some <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/listing-agent-vs-buyer-agent/">represent sellers</a>, some facilitate transactions as a neutral party, and in some cases different salespeople in a single firm <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/dual-agency/">may represent different parties</a> within a transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What experience do you have in my immediate area?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How long are homes in this neighborhood typically on the market?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Be aware that because all homes are unique, some will sell faster than others. Several factors can impact the amount of time a home remains on the market, including list price, changing interest rates and local economic trends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How would you price my home?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ask about recent home sales and comparable properties currently on the market. If you speak with several Realtors and their price estimates differ, that’s alright—but be sure to ask how their price opinions were determined and why they think your home would sell for a given value. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How will you market my home?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At listing presentations, brokers will provide a detailed summary of how they market homes, what marketing strategies have worked in the past and which marketing efforts may be effective for your home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your fee?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/real-estate-commission-explained/">commission</a> is the agent’s rate for handling your transaction. Ask if there are other fees you will have to pay such as a early cancellation fee, marketing fee, transaction fee or any other cost that is not included in the commission rate.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What disclosures should you receive?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">State rules require brokers to provide extensive agency disclosure information, usually at the first sit-down meeting with an owner or buyer.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Mortgages</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numbers of different methods for repaying a loan, however, there are only three types of mortgages: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">1. Conventional Mortgage Loans</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A conventional mortgage loan is any loan that is not inured or guaranteed </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">by an agency of the government. Conventional mortgage loans made by lending institutions, and private lenders are the predominate method in which single-family residences are financed. To offset the higher risk, and to allow conventional lenders to compete with FHA and VA loans, private mortgage insurance was developed. The Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation (MGIC) introduced private mortgage insurance (PMI). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">2.FHA Insured Mortgage Loans</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The FHA does not make loans. Instead, it insures loans made by approved local lenders. A landing institution, such as a mortgage company, bank, or savings and loan association, funds the loans. Although there is no income limits to determine who is eligible for FHA insured mortgage loans, FHA’s mortgage insurance programs help low- and moderate-income families become homeowners by lowering some of the costs of their mortgage loans. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are numbers of different FHA insured mortgage loan programs under the authority of HUD. The most common ones are:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>FHA Section 203(b) mortgage insurance. </b>This program offers basic mortgage insurance for the purchase or refinance of owner-occupied one-to-four family home. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>FHA Section 203(k) rehabilitation mortgage insurance.</b> This program enables homebuyers to finance both the purchase of a one- to four-family dwelling and the cost of its rehabilitation through a single long-term fixed or adjustable rate mortgage. </span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Beware Of The Fees Involved</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When buying a home, most people focus on how much it costs and what interest rate they can get on the loan. While that is certainly very important, the other fees that come with buying a home are often overlooked. Here is a list of the most common fees involved when buying a home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Points or origination fees:</b> An origination fee is paid to the bank or lender for their services in creating the loan. A point is 1 percent of the loan, and is often worked into the total cost of the loan. Ask for a </span><span class="s2">good faith estimate so you have an idea of how much their mortgage origination fees are.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Credit report fees:</b> In order to secure a loan, the lender will require a verified credit report.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Private mortgage insurance:</b> If you only provide a small down payment, you may be required to purchase private mortgage insurance. Sometimes this means you are required to pay a full year’s worth at time of purchase, or it will be rolled into your monthly payment.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Homeowner’s insurance:</b> When borrowing money to purchase a home, insurance is required. In many cases, this means buying a policy before closing on the home.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Title insurance:</b> This insurance covers you in the unlikely case that the person who sold you the house didn’t actually own it or if information on the title was false.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Appraisal fees:</b> An appraisal is needed so that a current fair market value for your home can be established for tax purposes. </span><span class="s1">Buyers sometimes pay for the appraisal when it takes place, and sometimes the fee is included in the closing costs paid on settlement day.</span><span class="s3"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Escrow fees:</b> During the closing process, you’ll probably have a portion of your monthly mortgage payment go into escrow in order to pay for property taxes and insurance.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Document preparation fees:</b> The lender or broker will usually have a fee to cover the preparation of the required documents for the loan.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Survey fee:</b> If an existing survey of the land cannot be obtained, a new survey will have to be conducted in order to determine exact boundaries of the property. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Home inspection:</b> Every buyer should have a home inspection, usually within 10 to 15 days after the contract is approved. Costs vary; the home inspection can set you back $325 or more. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pest or mold inspection:</b> While not generally required for a brand new home, the purchase of an older home may require an inspection for pests such as termites as well as mold. This requirement can vary by location.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Property taxes:</b> In some cases, you may owe some property taxes immediately if the seller has already paid taxes for a time period where you will be the owner. Also, there may be other municipal taxes or fees for sewer or water that need to be taken care of.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>State recording fees:</b> Depending on where you live, there may be a fee required for recording and holding the information regarding the sale.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Cash reserves:</b> Lenders typically want you to have at least two house payments, including principal, interest, taxes and insurance, in the bank after the closing.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You spend a lot of cash when you buy a home. The down payment for your mortgage is only one expense. There are other outlays like moving costs and necessary home purchases. The costs add up.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you sell your home</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><b>Decide when to sell</b> In real estate, timing can influence your home’s selling price. Factors like how quickly you need to sell, whether it’s a buyers or sellers market and seasonality all play a role in your home’s final selling price.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Find a REALTOR® who is right for you</b> The REALTOR® who helped you buy your home is a good place to start. They already know your home and they know you, so you’ll be saving time right from the start. Or do the research to find the right one in your neighborhood or ask your friends and family. Make sure to interview two or three candidates and choose the one you like best.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Determine your home’s asking price</b> The right asking price will attract buyers and pay you a maximum return. Over-pricing can discourage buyers and may make them look into competing homes with better value. Price the true market value and not the price which you think your home is worth. You can then do adjustments on the pricing based on the additional or lacking features and amenities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Sign a Listing Agreement</b> This authorizes your REALTOR® and their brokerage to market and sell your home. It will define the legal relationship between you and the real estate brokerage and also set a time limit for your REALTOR® to sell your home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Add some specialists to your team</b> Similar to when you bought your home, it’s essential to have a notary public or a lawyer handle all the various documents that change hands and make sure your best interests are being protected at all times.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Prepare your home for sale</b> First impressions matter. Now is the time to see your home through a buyer’s eyes: </span><span class="s1">Cleaning and eliminating excess things inside your home can make your home look more spacious and attractive to buyers.</span> <span class="s1">Make the necessary repairs and make the decoration neutral as various buyers have different style and taste.</span><span class="s2"> Remember, weigh the cost of all your improvements versus the potential financial return.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Let your REALTOR® do what they do best</b> Your home has never looked so good and now it’s time for your REALTOR® to market it to potential buyers. This happens with a “For Sale” sign, open houses, pictures to use in flyers,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>listing on the MLS®, the internet, and, of course, through your REALTORS®’ relationship with other REALTORS®.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare your finances</b> Will you have a mortgage to pay off? If you’re buying a new home, will you have to wait until you sell your current home? What taxes are involved? These are important questions to ask your REALTOR®, your mortgage lender and your lawyer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare for Negotiation</b> Although your REALTOR® will walk you through the process, be prepared for some stress. Create a list of things you are open for negotiation. These can be the price, closing date and repairs. You will have three options: you can accept, you can reject or you can “counter”. Ask your REALTOR® what these terms mean. Happy negotiating!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Close the deal</b> You were successful and have a complete legally binding purchase agreement. Are you done? Not quite yet. </span><span class="s1">The lawyer and title company will prepare the process to close. Your buyer&#8217;s lender will handle the appraisal which can help confirm the home value and outstanding liens. An inspection on your property will take place to make sure that the agreed repairs and changes are completed. Finally, in the closing date, all the moneys will be collected, deed will be transferred, existing loans will be paid, and title will be completed. You as the seller will then receive the proceeds from the home sale. </span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Appraisal Process</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most home buyers or refinancers offer little praise for appraisals. Home Appraisal methods often leave consumers feeling like the process is more a magician’s trick than a mathematical calculation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help clear up any questions, here are some basic facts about the home appraisal:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is a home appraisal?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A home appraisal is an expert’s opinion of how much your home is worth. Most lenders will require an objective, third-party, certified appraiser to determine the fair market value of a property before closing. This protects you from spending more on a home than it’s actually worth. It also protects your lender from loaning out too much money.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How did they come up with THAT figure?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Appraisers are trained to look at certain aspects of a home to develop a value. And, sometimes their methods and conclusions don’t seem to make much sense. But, there is a method to their madness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An appraisal is based on information that’s similar to the information Realtors® use for a comparative market analysis, including the specifics of your house such as square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the location and age of the property and interior improvements. These facts about your home will be compared to other homes that the appraiser considers comparable to come up with your home value.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The appraiser also will check the status of the major systems and structure of the house. Is there water, termite, or mold damage? Does the plumbing leak? Will any major systems or structures need replacement, such as the roof? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Appraisers will pay close attention to home improvements and upgrades, too. This is perhaps the most confusing area for new buyers and sellers. For example, a house that has been modified to become unique can work against a home’s value. Remember, the value of a house is largely driven by demand. While most passersby may appreciate a unique or differently designed house, far fewer want to live in one. For example, there likely would be fewer buyers if the old lady who lived in a shoe decided to sell!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the physical inspection, the appraiser will then double check the findings with housing data provided by local county records to ensure accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Comparables</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next step is for the appraiser to look at comparables. Comparables are similar homes that have recently sold in the general area or the specific neighborhood. Appraisers look for houses that share similar characteristics with the subject property, such as size, age, and style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to remember, however, that appraisers will only use homes listed within the past 3-6 months. The ultimate goal is to use comparables that reflect today’s housing market values.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By studying this data, your appraiser can then estimate your home’s current worth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Final Report and Value</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The last step in the home appraisal process is preparing a final report of value. This report will provide you and your lender with a complete property analysis. And, it will outline how an appraiser calculated your home’s worth. Typically, the final report of value will include some of the following details:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Size and condition of the house</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Comments about serious structural problems, like cracked foundations </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Permanent fixtures, such as lights, ceiling fans, and faucets</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Details about any home renovations</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Comments about the surrounding area</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Maps, photographs, and sketches of the property</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A detailed market analysis</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Who pays for the home appraisal?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the bank will typically arrange for an appraisal, the buyer is ultimately responsible for footing the bill. Generally, appraisals cost between $300-$500, depending on the size of your home and property. It’s also important to note that this fee will be collected regardless of whether or not you choose to purchase the home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But don’t worry. The home appraisal only comes once the buyer and seller agree on a price and sign documents to start the closing process. You don’t need to do appraisals on every house you choose to bid on.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What can go wrong with appraisals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If there is a significant difference between the agreed selling price and the appraised value of the home, your bank may decide not to fund the mortgage and the deal could fall through. The bank doesn’t want you to overpay and, thus, over borrow for a home. If your contract is contingent on an appraisal, one option you have is to withdraw your offer and have your earnest money deposit returned. The appraisal has saved you from paying too much for the home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you prefer to buy the home anyway or have waived the appraisal contingency to make your offer more attractive to the sellers, you have a few other options:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Challenge the appraisal with documentation from your Realtor®</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Pay for a second appraisal, which may or may not come in higher</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Come up with extra cash to make up the difference between the appraised value and your purchase price</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Renegotiate the contract, if the seller is willing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your Realtor® can advise you about the appraisal process and help you decide how to handle a low appraisal to match your interests.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The biggest turn off to buyers is an over-priced home. Experts say it’s acceptable to reach for the moon when pricing a home if it’s move-in ready and doesn’t need any upgrades or maintenance. But a home that requires work and comes with a big price tag isn’t going to generate a lot of interest, let alone bids.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s5">2.</span><span class="s4"><b> Overpricing your home. </b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s4">If you’ve hired the right REALTOR®, someone who can give you a strong market analysis and help you determine a <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/how-much-is-your-home-really-worth/#.UtAjQ_t5aHM"><span class="s6">reasonable price</span></a> for your home, then you can avoid overpricing your home. If you don’t listen to a REALTOR® and base your listing price on an inflated view of your home’s value, you’re likely to end up selling after multiple price drops for less than you would have if you <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/homes-first-price-best-price/"><span class="s6">priced it right the first time</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">3.<b> Letting your pets and kids spoil a sale. </b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s4">Part of your emotional detachment from your home is recognizing that while you love Fluffy and your darling twins, buyers want to visualize themselves and their own family in your home. Bribe your kids if you have to, but make sure the house is neat and as <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/10-interior-design-trends-turn-off-home-buyers/"><span class="s6">neutral-looking</span></a> and smelling as possible. Take the kids and your pets out (or lock up your pets) when prospective buyers are visiting: You never know if someone who is terrified of dogs or cats will be turned off from making an offer because of your adorable pet.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">4.</span><span class="s4"><b> Withholding information from buyers. </b></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s4">If you hope that the buyers or their inspector <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/full-disclosure-what-you-need-to-tell-buyers-about-your-home/"><span class="s7">will not find out</span></a> about the leak under your bathroom sink or the fact that your basement gets flooded every winter, you run the risk of a nasty negotiating period—or worse, a lawsuit after the settlement.</span><span class="s8"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s9">5.</span><b> </b><span class="s4"><b>Skimping on your sales prep. </b></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s4">While you may be tempted to “test the waters” and put your home on the market without painting it or making minor repairs, your home is likely to languish on the market and get a reputation for having a major problem. A thorough, <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/cleaning-house-before-selling/"><span class="s7">professional-level cleaning</span></a> should be your bare minimum <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/preparing-to-sell-your-house/#.UtAjaPt5aHM"><span class="s7">seller prep</span></a>. Your eventual sales price is likely to be lower if you don’t sell within the first few weeks after you list your home.</span></p>
</div>
</div><div class="vc_toggle vc_toggle_default vc_toggle_color_Default  vc_toggle_size_md">
	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Before you list your home</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you speak to a Real Estate professional about selling your home you should be clear on the motives of your move, home much money you expect to receive for the sale and how much will you need to pay off your mortgage or to buy a new property. You also need to inform your Realtor how much time you think will take to accomplish these activities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A common mistake Realtors make is assume the value of your property; the fact that a neighbor is selling or asking a high price does not mean the neighbor or yourself will be able to sell it for more. Ask your Realtor to provide you with comparables of properties sold in the last 6 months and focus on marketing your home based on the actual past sales and not on the price of the properties listed for sale. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you list your home, make some important decisions and take the appropriate action to increase the opportunities to sell your home fast and at the best price.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Financial Decisions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make these decisions before you place your home for sale:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you plan to buy another property and you need the money from your current home, include a contingency in your offer. That is to say, specify in the contract that your purchase depends on the sale of your current home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure you qualify to obtain financing if you are going to purchase another home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sell your place at reasonable market price. Don’t waste time offering it at a higher price than the market will pay. The only thing you will accomplish is to help your neighbor sell his faster!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are working with a Real Estate Agent, make sure you understand and agree on compensation/ commission. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a list of articles you would like to sell and a list of things you don’t. There two reasons for this. One, is the buyer may assume some articles are included in the sale, for example; curtains, lamps or fixed furniture. To avoid these complications which will delay the sale, specify what is included and excluded in the sale. Two, the buyer might be interested and able to purchase some articles in your home like paintings or furniture. You might make an objective decision of what you would like to keep and what is the value of your things if you think about it ahead of time instead of being pressured by the sale of the property.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Inspection</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1">A home inspection is a crucial element of any home purchase. Most buyers make their purchase offer contingent on the results of a home inspection so they can decide not to buy if the inspection reveals significant structural problems. In a market with heavy competition for homes, buyers sometimes waive the home-inspection contingency to make their offer more appealing to the sellers. Even in those circumstances, it’s advisable to schedule an ‘information-only’ inspection so you know what you’re buying.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your home inspection can cost between $300 and $600, depending on where you live and the size of the property you’re having inspected. It’s worth spending a few hundred dollars to learn about the potential pitfalls of your future home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What to expect from your home inspector</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your Realtor can recommend a home inspector, but you may also want to get recommendations from your lender and an attorney. Check out each home inspector’s credentials and reputation online and ask how many inspections each has completed. Most home inspectors will provide a written report after the inspection, but you should ask to see a sample report and how long it will take until you receive your report before choosing your inspector.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Prep for your inspection</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You should always attend the inspection since this is your opportunity to learn about how to take care of your home. Prepare a list of questions for the inspector and bring a notebook or tablet so you can take notes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before your inspection look over the interior and exterior of the property for potential problems and areas you would like the inspector to review carefully, such as dark spots in the ceiling or underneath the bathroom sinks that could be water damage. Depending on the rules in your area, the seller may be required to disclose known defects in the home. Ask the seller’s agent, your buyer’s agent, and even the neighbors if they know about any issues with that house or condo.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What to do during your inspection</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While your inspector is looking for major issues such as a foundation problem, a leaky roof or mold, you should also use the hours of your inspection to learn how to take care of the home and its systems. Find out where the water shut-off valve is and ask for advice on how to maintain the property. Most home inspectors can tell you the life expectancy of your appliances so you can avoid being surprised when it’s time to replace the water heater. A good inspector will also point out small repairs you should make after you move into the property.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the inspector finds a major problem with the home you intend to buy, you’ll need to consult with your Realtor and review your contract to decide how to handle the problem. Depending on what the inspection reveals, you may want to pull out of the deal or request that the sellers address the issue. You, the sellers and your agents can negotiate whether you want the sellers to fix a problem, give you a credit at settlement, or cash to make the repairs after you move in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A good home inspection should do more than look for flaws, it should prepare you for homeownership.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Prepping and staging a home</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1">Every seller wants her home to sell fast and bring top dollar. Does that sound good to you? Well, it&#8217;s not luck that makes that happen. It&#8217;s careful planning and knowing how to professionally spruce up your home that will send home buyers scurrying for their checkbooks. Here is how to prep a house and turn it into an irresistible and marketable home.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Disassociate Yourself With Your Home.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Say to yourself, <i>&#8220;This is not my home; it is a house &#8212; a product to be sold..</i> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Make the mental decision to &#8220;let go&#8221; of your emotions and focus on the fact that soon this house will no longer be yours. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Picture yourself handing over the keys and envelopes containing appliance warranties to the new owners! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Say goodbye to every room. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Don&#8217;t look backwards &#8212; look toward the future. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>De-Personalize.</b><br />
Pack up those personal photographs and family heirlooms. Buyers can&#8217;t see past personal artifacts, and you don&#8217;t want them to be distracted. You want buyers to imagine their own photos on the walls, and they can&#8217;t do that if yours are there! You don&#8217;t want to make any buyer ask,<i> &#8220;I wonder what kind of people live in this home?&#8221;</i> You want buyers to say, <i>&#8220;I can see </i><b><i>myself</i></b><i> living here.&#8221;</i> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>De-Clutter!</b><br />
People collect an amazing quantity of junk. Consider this: if you haven&#8217;t used it in over a year, you probably don&#8217;t need it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you don&#8217;t need it, why not donate it or throw it away? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Remove all books from bookcases. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pack up those knickknacks. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clean off everything on kitchen counters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Put essential items used daily in a small box that can be stored in a closet when not in use. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will eventually need to do anyway. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Rearrange Bedroom Closets and Kitchen Cabinets. </b><br />
<a href="http://homebuying.about.com/od/sellingahouse/a/Privateshowings.htm"><span class="s2">Buyers love to snoop</span></a></span> <span class="s1">and will open closet and cabinet doors. Think of the message it sends if items fall out! Now imagine what a buyer believes about you if she sees everything organized. It says you probably take good care of the rest of the house as well. This means: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Neatly stack dishes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Turn coffee cup handles facing the same way. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hang shirts together, buttoned and facing the same direction. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Line up shoes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Rent a Storage Unit. </b><br />
Almost every home shows better with less furniture. Remove pieces of furniture that block or hamper paths and walkways and put them in storage. Since your bookcases are now empty, store them. Remove anything to make the room appear larger. Leave just enough furniture in each room to showcase the room&#8217;s purpose and plenty of room to move around. You don&#8217;t want buyers scratching their heads and saying,<i> &#8220;What is this room used for?&#8221;</i> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Remove/Replace Favorite Items.</b><br />
If you want to take window coverings, built-in appliances or fixtures with you, remove them now. If the chandelier in the dining room once belonged to your great grandmother, take it down. If a buyer never sees it, she won&#8217;t want it. Once you tell a buyer she can&#8217;t have an item, she will covet it, and it could blow your deal. Pack those items and replace them, if necessary. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="http://homebuying.about.com/od/sellingahouse/qt/ResaleRepairs.htm"><b>Make Minor Repairs</b></a><b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Replace cracked floor or counter tiles.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Patch holes in walls. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fix leaky faucets. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fix doors that don&#8217;t close properly and kitchen drawers that jam. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consider painting your walls neutral colors, especially if you have grown accustomed to purple or pink walls.<br />
(Don&#8217;t give buyers any reason to remember your home as &#8220;the house with the orange bathroom.&#8221;) </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Replace burned-out light bulbs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;ve considered replacing a worn bedspread, do so now!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Make the House Sparkle!</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wash windows inside and out. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rent a pressure washer and spray down sidewalks and exterior. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clean out cobwebs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Re-caulk tubs, showers and sinks. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Polish chrome faucets and mirrors. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clean out the refrigerator. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clean floors daily. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dust furniture, ceiling fan blades and light fixtures. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bleach dingy grout. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Replace worn rugs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hang up fresh towels. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clean and air out any musty smelling areas. Odors are a no-no.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Scrutinize. </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Linger in the doorway of every single room and imagine how your house will look to a buyer. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Examine carefully how furniture is arranged and move pieces around until it makes sense. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Make sure window coverings hang level. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tune in to the room&#8217;s statement and its emotional pull. Does it have impact and pizzazz? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Does it look like nobody lives in this house? You&#8217;re almost finished.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Check Curb Appeal.</b><br />
If a buyer won&#8217;t get out of her agent&#8217;s car because she doesn&#8217;t like the exterior of your home, you&#8217;ll never get her inside. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keep the sidewalks cleared. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mow the lawn. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Paint faded window trim. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Plant yellow flowers or group flower pots together. Yellow evokes a buying emotion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trim your bushes. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Make sure visitors can clearly read your house number.</span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>Taxes</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three primary taxing districts in Florida: 1) city, 2) county, and 3) school board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also, there are many smaller special taxing districts that provide neighborhoods with certain types of services not provide to the entire area, such as fire control district, flood control districts, mosquito control districts and many others. Residents who live outside of a taxation authority would not have taxes levied for that taxing district. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tax rates in Florida are expressed in mills. A mill is a decimal that is equivalent of 1/1,000 of a dollar. Each taxation authority first establishes a budget, which forecasts the amount of revenue that is necessary for the coming year. Money that is expected from all sources, other than real estate taxes, is estimated. It includes items such as parking meter and traffic fine income, state and federal revenue sharing, and so on. By subtracting this sun from the budget, the amount that is needed from real estate taxes may be estimated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Real Estate property taxes are <i>ad valorem taxes, </i>which means “according to value” and therefore, are based on the value of the property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The county property appraiser in each county assesses all property for real estate tax purposes each year. The estimate of value that is determined. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Homestead Exemption</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All legal Florida residents are eligible for a Homestead Exemption on their homes, condominiums, co-op apartments, and certain mobilehome lots if they qualify. The Florida Constitution provides this tax-saving exemption on the first and third $25,000 of the assessed value of an owner/occupied residence. </span></p>

	<div class="vc_toggle_title"><h4>What’s the price of selling your home?</h4><i class="vc_toggle_icon"></i></div>
	<div class="vc_toggle_content"><p class="p1">As a seller, you’re bound to face a parade of taxes, fees, commissions and miscellaneous closing costs that can whittle away up to 4 to 7 percent of your home’s sale price.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, how do you know what net profit you’ll walk away with? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs vary from state to state, but in general these are some of the closing fees you may encounter:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Mortgage payoff balance.</b> Deductions from the sale price include your own home loan, second mortgages and home-equity lines of credit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Loan payoff fee.</b> Some lenders may charge you an administrative fee to pay off your loan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Lien releases.</b> If you owe money to a contractor or for court judgments or property taxes, a lien may have been placed on your property. You must pay those liens before the sale can close.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Prepayment penalty.</b> Find out from your lender if there’s a penalty for paying off your loan early.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Recording fees.</b> If you owe money on the property, you need to pay this fee to show that your debts have been fully paid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Commissions for listing and selling agents. </b>This is the price you pay to the agents for making the sale of your house. Usually the fee is 6 percent, with half going to your agent’s brokerage and the rest going to the buyer’s agent’s brokerage. The agents get paid by their respective brokerages.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Notary fees.</b> Fee charged by a notary to verify your identity and to make sure the documents are executed properly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Escrow fees.</b> The escrow company is the intermediary between you and the buyer, ensuring that the money is handled properly. Escrow agents receive money from the lender, pay off your mortgage and closing costs, collect deposits and give the proceeds to the lender. You may be able to split these costs with the buyer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Title search fees.</b> Title insurance is not insurance per se but says that you have the legal right to sell your home. Title companies search public records to come up with a title insurance commitment. That commitment says you own the home, and it details anything else that may affect the title, such as mortgages, liens, easements, restrictions and home owner association declarations.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Seller concession.</b> A seller concession helps buyers pay their closing costs. If the buyer asks you for a concession of, for example, 3 percent, that amount will be added to your agreed-upon home price, and you will give back that 3 percent to the buyer to pay for closing costs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Repairs.</b> You may be required to pay for repairs, either by negotiation with the buyer or by a condition of the lender.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Home warranty.</b> Sometimes a seller will agree to foot the bill for a home warranty that offers a protection plan for the buyer’s first year in the home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After an agreement has been reached to sell the home, sellers remain responsible for such ongoing costs as mortgage interest, property taxes and homeowner association dues until the property officially changes hands. If a home inspector finds problems with a house or condominium, the seller may negotiate a credit to be paid to the buyer at closing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whether you are a buyer or a seller, make sure you are financially prepared for closing costs. Factor them in when you calculate the price of real estate transactions.</span></p>
