The following files are present in the IDX download files. The file naming
conventions vary based on the MLS, so the text "MLS" will be used in place
of the actual MLS name. For example the file name may actually be naples.zip,
but this file will refer to that file as MLS.zip.

MLS_data.zip - Contains a text file (MLS_data.txt) of the IDX listing data.
